## Mission
Our business is primarily to sell an app to schools and teachers around the world that offers a precise and convenient way of tracking the group discussions to an immediate and multi-faceted analysis or feedback of student participation. With the app, teachers can gather a vast amount of data that provides both specific and comprehensive insights into the students and discussions. Using various segments of analysis that the app offers, teachers can give effective feedback to the students to assist their development. The app is personalized from the start to the end based on the groups(classes) and materials that the user(teacher) creates for themself, allowing its smooth integration into any classroom or discussion setting.
